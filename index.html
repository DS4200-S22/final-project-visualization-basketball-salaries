    <h1>Abstract</h1>
        
    <p>
      Visualizations depicting statistics from NBA players are necessary to help fans better understand the game and its players. For our project, we decided to take a look at statistical data we have collected from the National Basketball Association that will help us with our analysis of NBA players. We plan to visualize the salaries of various players in order to make comparisons and draw inferences based on their performance, and the ultimate goal is to determine whether a specified playerâ€™s worth is reflected through their salaries.
