    <h1>Abstract</h1>
        
    <p>
      Visualizations depicting statistics from NBA players are necessary to help fans better understand the game and its players. For our project, we decided to take a look at statistical data we have collected from the National Basketball Association that will help us with our analysis of NBA players. We plan to visualize the salaries of various players in order to make comparisons and draw inferences based on their performance, and the ultimate goal is to determine whether a specified playerâ€™s worth is reflected through their salaries.

  <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>
  
  <p>
    Our graphic aims to give the viewer with a tool for examining NBA player performance and its relationship to salary. As a result, we give a grid of seven scatter plots that depict the salary distribution of APG, PPG, AGE, MPG, BPG, SPG, and RPG. When you click on one of the scatter plots, it changes and links to the large scatter plot in the centre of the page. We can brush the enormous scatter plot that we chose and watch the spots that we choose appear in the bar plot. If you wish to view a specific player's position, you may also choose the position bar, which will appear in the scatter plot.
