00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.899
Hello, Our group is visualizing basketball
player salaries.

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.249
When you first land on the home page, you
land on the home page, you are greeted with

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:10.390
a grid of seven scatter plots that show the
distributions of assists per game, points

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.420
per game, the age of the player, the steals
per game, the blocks per game, the minutes

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.829
played per game, and the rebounds per game
in relation to the salary of each player in

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:21.019
our database.

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:26.630
Below, you are shown a larger scatter plot
here that initially shows the points per game

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.689
with relation to the salary.

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.230
As well as the distribution of player in the
NBA in regards to their position.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.490
So we are able to brush over this section
of the scatter plot and we are able to see

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.340
the players who play the most but also make
the most money are power forwards, point guards,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.990
forwards, and guards.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.160
We are able to also compare the performance
of say centers and guards in the NBA.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.010
And we see that guards score significantly
more points but also make more money.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.990
However, we are able to come back up here
and click on say the scatter plot that shows

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.850
the blocks per game with relation to salary,
and we are able to perform the same comparison,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.360
comparing centers to guards, and we see that
guards block very few shots but get paid a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.180
lot of money where as centers block a significant
amount of shots per game but don't get paid

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.180
too much.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.360
We are also able to do the same exact for
rebounds or any of the other scatter plots

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.360
here.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.159
We are also able to see below that we can
select two players.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.640
We will compare Nikola Jokic, and Al Horford.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.280
We see that Nikola Jokic gets paid very little
in his first year, but he scored more points

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.870
than Al Horford in all three years he was
in the NBA.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.229
He had significantly more steals per game
and significantly more assists per game even

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.880
though his pay does not represent this.
